# 1.0 Critique of Visualisation

The original visualisation can be seen below as reference:

![](img/original.jpg)

### 1.1 Critique of Clarity

**1. Hidden details**

Due to the circles being opaque and bad placement of the labels, some details are unclear. The centre point of the bubble will help viewers distinguish between “Net Importers” and “Net Exporters” however, in some cases, this centre point is hidden. E.g. Taiwan’s centre point was covered by United States’ label while Malaysia, EU and Republic of Korea have their centre point covered by other circles. As such, it is unclear where the centre point falls.

**2. Not hidden but still unclear details**

Furthermore, Japan’s centre point falls between Exports and Imports. Unsure if Japan is a net exporter or importer.

**3. Lack of title and other explanatory text**

There is no title to the graph, so viewers are unsure what this graph is supposed to be for.

There is also a lack of dates, thus viewers are unsure which period this graph is about. The tooltip talks about dates like 2009 and 2006 but we are unsure of how did this tooltip come about from the graph.

Furthermore, there is no explanation on which markets the EU consists of, especially since Brexit, this might need to be clarified. There are also 2 entries from Republic of Korea in the data (one is Democratic), clarification about which was used should be written.


### 1.2 Critique of Aesthetics

**Colours**

While Net Importer and Net Exporter colours were good as they are both mild on the eyes and distinguishable from each other, there is just way too many colours on the graph which makes it hard to focus on the details. Furthermore, some colours were indistinguishable from each other, e.g. Thailand and EU have  purple-blue tones and it is not easy to tell them apart. Japan is yellow and yellow font on white background is not a good idea. Further more, dotted yellow lines tend to become invisible. EU's colour contrasts too strongly with Malaysia's colour, this causes distress to the eyes and a reddish outline due to the visual illusion this causes (chromostereopsis).

**Hidden Tooltips**

Due to the circles being opaque, some labels are partially hidden (e.g. Malaysia and Indonesia) 

**Use of icons and ambiguous location of axis labels**

There is not much of a point to add the icons to Exports and Imports since we can already tell from the text. Plus it confuses the viewers’ eyes since Exports is above Imports which could possibly confuse viewers at first glance, since net exporters are technically below net importers on the graph.

# 2.0 Suggest Alternative Graphical Presentation

The plan is to create a dashboard with an interactive graph that allows switching the graph through the years by the use of a dropdown list. The goal is to clearly answer the following: 

1. Which market had higher trade with Singapore during the period?

2. Was the market a net importer or exporter with Singapore?

3. What was the proportion of exports vs imports?

Also, a static table will be placed in the dashboard so that viewers who want answers on market rankings in terms of total trade volume across the years can get their answers as fast as possible without the interactive graph.

The graph and the table are meant to complement each other in the sense that the graph will give more details to the table.

![](img/suggestion.PNG)

The dashboard will have the following:

* One interactive graph for Export, Import and Average for the markets across the periods
* One static table for rankings of markets based on total trade volume with Singapore

To note, the tooltip for the interactive graph will contain the following information for the respective periods:

* Total trade
* Net trade
* Whether the market is a net importer or exporter
* Total exports
* Total imports
* Export-import ratio


### 2.1 Improvement to Clarity

1. Titles and subtitles to explain graphs more clearly. 
2. Tooltips show more relevant information. See previous section for said information.
3. Imports and Exports will be on the same axis to easily compare them.
4. Dates will clearly be shown.
5. Clarification on ambiguous markets like EU and Republic of Korea will be given.
6. Tooltips will only appear when hovering over specific portions of the interactive graph, which allows viewers to see the graph properly before reading the tooltip.
7. There is no opague overlap between markets and they are clearly segmented.
8. Net importers and exporters will be clearly coloured to distinguish between them.

### 2.2 Improvement to Aesthetic

1. There will not be any opague elements that will overlap with other elements so everything will be shown clearly. Other than tooltips which will only appear when hovered over.
2. Only 3 colours will be present in the graph to avoid confusing viewers. Black, pink and green.
3. Removal of unneeded visuals like icons that do not add to the value of the visual.


# 3.0 Alternative Graphical Presentation

![](img/alternative.PNG)

Please view the interactive dashboard on Tableau Public [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/joyce.woon/viz/DataViz2_16240401638120/Dashboard1).

For a preview of the individual graph, table and tooltips, please refer to 6.0 Appendix.

# 4.0 Data Visualisation Preparation

### 4.1 Data Source

##### 4.1.1 Creating the tables

1. Open the excel file in Tableau.
2. Check "Use Data Interpreter" in Data Source.
3. Under data source, drag T1 and T2 into the white space as such and edit their relationship so that Variables = Variables (T2)

![](img/4.1.1.1.3.png)

##### 4.1.2 Preparing the table

1. Select all the date columns of T1, right click on the column and click Pivot. Repeat for T2.
2. Right click and delete the following columns:

| Table |          Column          |
|:-----:|:------------------------:|
|   T1  |    Variables - Split 2   |
|   T2  | Variables (T2) - Split 2 |


3. Right click Pivot Field Values in T1 and click Create Calculated Field. Rename the calculated field to Values (Import) and enter the following calculation before clicking OK:

> IF [Variables  - Split 1] = 'European Union'
> 
> THEN [Pivot Field Values]*1000
> 
> ELSE [Pivot Field Values]
> 
> END

4. Right click Pivot Field Values in T2 and click Create Calculated Field. Rename the calculated field to Values (Export) and enter the following calculation before clicking OK:

> IF [Variables (T2) - Split 1] = 'European Union'
> 
> THEN [Pivot Field Values (Pivot1)]*1000
> 
> ELSE [Pivot Field Values (Pivot1)]
> 
> END

> Steps 3 and 4 need to be done as European Union were in Millions while the rest of the markets were in Thousands.

5. Right click on the respective columns and rename as follows:

| Table |    Original Name    | New Name |
|:-----:|:-------------------:|:--------:|
|   T1  |  Pivot Field Names  |   Dates  |
|   T1  | Variables - Split 1 |  Markets |

> The reason why we do not rename the rest of the columns is because we are not using them during the course of this visualisation.

6. Click on the Abc on the Dates column in T1 and click Date. Repeat the same for Pivot Field Names (T2) in T2.

##### 4.1.3 Adding filters

1. On the top right of Data Source under Filters, click add. 
2. Under Edit Data Source Filters, click add…. Select Dates, click OK, select $ Years, click Next, check 2011 to 2020 and press OK. Repeat for Pivot Field Names (Pivot 1) in T2.
3. Under Edit Data Source Filters, click add…. Select Markets (Export), click OK, select Malaysia, Mainland China, European Union, United States, Taiwan, Japan, Republic of Korea, Indonesia, Thailand and Hong Kong and press OK. Repeat for Variables (T2) – Split 1 in T2.

By the end of this step, Edit Data Source Filters should look like this.

# 5.0 Derived Insights

1. Export/Import: Hong Kong has the largest Export/Import ratio with exports being approximately as high as Malaysia (rank 2 in total trade). However, due to low imports, ranking in Total Trade is low.

2. Net Exporter/Importer: Most countries do not change from Net Exporter to Net Importer or vice versa throughout the years. The only markets that experienced changes were Mainland China, Malaysia and Republic of Korea.

3. Total Trade: Unlike the above, markets do change in ranking in terms of total trade with Singapore. The only markets that do not exhibit change are Mainland China and Malaysia with the top 2 ranks and Thailand with the last rank.The markets that exhibit change were EU and US, which changed between ranks 4 and 5, Indonesia, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan and Republic of Korea are more volatile and changed between ranks 6 to 9.
